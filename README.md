The following Projects are currently being completed for Stanford University Machine Learning Course. The programming assigments are in MATLAB however as an additional side project I am converting the MATLAB code to python code.

1. Programming Assignment: [Linear Regression](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/stanford-machine-learning/tree/master/Project1)
2. Programming Assignment: [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/stanford-machine-learning/tree/master/Project2)
3. Programming Assignment: [Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/stanford-machine-learning/tree/master/Project3)
4. Programming Assignment: [Neural Network Learning](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/stanford-machine-learning/tree/master/Project4)
5. Programming Assignment: [Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/stanford-machine-learning/tree/master/Project5/MATLAB)
